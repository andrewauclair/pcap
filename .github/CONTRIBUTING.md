When you have fixed a bug, please create a [pull request](https://github.com/ardikars/pcap/pulls) on GitHub. Make sure that you have accurately described your changes and the fixed bug. Don't forget to provide a test case that reproduces the problem and proves that your fix is working. If you add new methods, fields, or types, make sure to write some in-code documentation that describes their purpose. Finally, please note that new releases are normally developed in their own branch whose name is identical to <majorVersion>.<minorVersion>.
